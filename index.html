<h1>Why Some Indian Cities Breathe Worse Air Than Others</h1>
<p class="lead">
When people talk about “air pollution,” they often imagine smoke-filled skies or the sharp
smell of exhaust. But the most dangerous form of urban air pollution is largely invisible.
It is made up of microscopic particles known as PM2.5 — particulate matter with a diameter
of less than 2.5 micrometers — small enough to bypass the body’s natural defenses and enter
the bloodstream through the lungs.
</p>

<p>
PM2.5 is not a single substance. It is a mixture of dust, soot, smoke, and chemical residues
released from vehicles, power plants, construction activity, industrial processes, and the
burning of fuels and waste. Because these particles are roughly thirty times smaller than the
width of a human hair, they remain suspended in the air for long periods and travel deep into
the respiratory system when inhaled.
</p>

<p>
Decades of epidemiological research have linked long-term exposure to PM2.5 with increased
risks of heart disease, stroke, asthma, reduced lung development, and premature death.
For this reason, PM2.5 has become the most widely used indicator of air pollution severity
in public health studies and regulatory frameworks worldwide.
</p>

<p>
Air Quality Index (AQI) values, which are commonly reported in weather apps and news
headlines, are derived from pollutant concentrations like PM2.5. Among these pollutants,
PM2.5 often dominates AQI calculations in Indian cities, especially during winter months.
In practice, this means that when AQI levels rise sharply, it is usually PM2.5 driving the
increase.
</p>


<p >
Air pollution in India is often discussed as a national emergency, but it is lived as a deeply
unequal urban experience. On some mornings, entire cities disappear behind a grey veil —
a haze of fine particulate matter that reduces visibility and quietly harms health — while
others breathe under comparatively clearer skies. These differences are not accidents of
chance. They are the outcome of systems.
</p>

<p>
India’s urbanisation story is frequently told through numbers — population growth, GDP
contribution, vehicle registrations, infrastructure spending. These metrics suggest that many
Indian cities are following similar developmental trajectories. Yet air quality data tells a very
different story. Cities that appear comparable on paper diverge sharply in how polluted their
air becomes, how long pollution lingers, and how often residents are exposed to hazardous
conditions.
</p>

<p>
This data science project examines air quality data from 2015 to 2024 to understand why
this divergence exists. We set out to answer: <em>Why do some Indian cities breathe worse air
than others, and what do the data say about causes and possible solutions?</em> Rather than
treating pollution as a single number or a collection of isolated events, the analysis
approaches air quality as a dynamic system shaped by emissions, geography, climate, and
timing. Delhi serves as the central case study — not because it is unique, but because it
reveals what happens when pollution has nowhere to go. The narrative below walks through
the data, visualisations, and evidence that lead to the conclusion.

<h2>Not All Cities Pollute the Same Way</h2>

<p>
If air pollution were simply a function of urban growth, India’s largest and fastest-growing
cities would all experience similar air quality outcomes. In reality, they do not.
</p>

<p>
To understand this divergence, we compare average Air Quality Index (AQI) levels across
major Indian cities between 2020 and 2024. This comparison reveals a striking imbalance.
While several cities face elevated pollution, one stands consistently apart.
</p>

</div>


<h2>Growth Creates Pressure, Not Destiny</h2>

<p>
It is tempting to assume that severe air pollution is simply the price paid for rapid growth.
More people generate more demand for mobility, housing, energy, and goods. This demand,
in turn, produces emissions. Under this logic, the most polluted cities should simply be the
largest or fastest-growing ones.
</p>

<p>
But this assumption collapses under comparison. Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Delhi
have all expanded rapidly over the past two decades. All have seen surges in vehicle ownership,
construction activity, and energy use. Yet only one of these cities repeatedly experiences
prolonged periods where air quality crosses into hazardous territory.
</p>

<p>
To ground the discussion, we begin with Delhi’s average air quality over recent years. The
yearly averages provide a useful baseline, not because they capture lived experience perfectly,
but because they reveal persistence.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">
    Yearly average AQI in Delhi from 2020 to 2024. Despite fluctuations, pollution remains
    consistently severe, indicating that short-term improvements do not alter long-term exposure.

    width="100%"
    height="550"
    style="border:none;"
    loading="lazy">
  </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Even during periods of reduced activity, such as the COVID lockdown, yearly averages remain
dominated by extreme winter pollution. This persistence suggests that emissions alone do not
fully explain Delhi’s air quality crisis.
</p>

<h2>When Pollution Has Nowhere to Escape</h2>

<div class="delhi-pollution">
  <p>
    The defining feature of Delhi’s pollution problem is not production but retention.
    Once pollutants enter the atmosphere, they remain suspended far longer than in many
    other Indian cities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Geography plays a decisive role. Delhi sits inland on flat terrain, far from coastal winds that
    help disperse pollutants. During winter months, weak wind speeds and frequent temperature
    inversions trap cold air near the surface, effectively sealing pollutants close to where people
    live and breathe.
  </p>

  <p>
    This behaviour becomes visible when air quality is examined month by month rather than
    year by year. Seasonal patterns repeat with remarkable consistency, overwhelming short-term
    policy interventions or behavioural changes.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="plot-block">

  </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
The implication is uncomfortable but clear: without addressing dispersion conditions,
emission reductions alone struggle to produce lasting improvements.
</p>

<h2>Diwali Reveals a Fragile System</h2>

<p>
Public discourse often frames Diwali as the primary cause of Delhi’s most severe pollution
episodes. Firecracker emissions do introduce a short-lived increase in particulate matter,
but isolating the festival as the cause obscures a more important reality.
</p>

<p>
Diwali arrives at a moment when Delhi’s atmosphere is already under stress. By late October
and early November, wind speeds weaken, temperatures begin to drop, and the conditions
that allow pollution to disperse start to collapse. In this state, even brief increases in
emissions can produce sharp and visible spikes in air quality indices.
</p>

<p>
Rather than creating a pollution crisis, Diwali exposes how little margin for error the system
has left. The same activity that might produce a modest effect at another time of year
can trigger a dramatic deterioration when dispersion conditions are already failing.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">
    Year-by-year AQI patterns around Diwali show a recurring spike across multiple years.
    The timing is consistent, but the magnitude varies depending on background pollution
    levels and meteorological conditions.

  </div>
</div>

<p>
Together, these patterns suggest that Diwali functions less as a cause and more as a
stress test. It reveals how close Delhi’s air quality system already is to failure each year,
long before a single firecracker is lit.

<p>
Diwali does not create Delhi’s air quality crisis. It reveals how close the system already is
to collapse — and how little additional pressure is required to push it there.
</p>


<h2>When Everything Stopped</h2>

<p>
In March 2020, India entered an unprecedented nationwide lockdown. Roads emptied,
factories shut down, construction halted, and air traffic nearly disappeared. For air
quality researchers, this moment created a rare natural experiment — a sudden,
near-total pause in urban emissions.
</p>

<p>
To understand how deeply everyday human activity shapes air quality, we compare
average AQI levels across Indian cities before COVID (2015–2019 baseline) with conditions
during the strict lockdown period (March–May 2020). City-level data from 23 monitoring
locations shows Delhi’s pre-lockdown average AQI of about 267 fell to roughly 133 during
the lockdown — a drop of over 130 points — while cities like Patna, Gurugram, and Lucknow
saw similar sharp improvements.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
Before the lockdown, air pollution followed a familiar pattern. Inland and landlocked
cities — particularly across northern India — recorded persistently high AQI levels,
while coastal cities benefited from stronger dispersion.
</p>

      style="border:none;"
      loading="lazy">
    </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
The improvement was immediate and widespread. Cities that routinely experienced
hazardous air quality saw dramatic declines within weeks. For a brief moment,
Delhi’s air resembled that of cities with far lower baseline pollution.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
The lockdown did not permanently solve India’s air pollution problem. But it revealed
something critical: urban air quality is highly responsive to human activity. The same
cities that suffer the most in normal times benefit the most when emissions are removed.
When restrictions eased, pollution returned — underscoring that lasting solutions
must address how pollution accumulates, not just how briefly it can be suppressed.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion: What the Data Show</h2>

<p>
Taken together, the analyses and visualisations in this project support a single, data-driven
story: Delhi’s air quality crisis cannot be explained by growth, festivals, or temporary
disruptions in isolation. It emerges from the interaction of emissions, geography, climate,
and timing. Other Indian cities grow rapidly without experiencing the same severity because
pollutants disperse more easily. In Delhi, they do not.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:16px;">Key findings</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:26px;">
  <li><strong>Inequality is spatial.</strong> The all-India map, state coverage map, and
  major-city comparison show that pollution is unevenly distributed. Delhi and the northern
  Indo-Gangetic belt consistently rank among the worst; coastal and southern cities often
  fare better despite comparable urbanisation.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence outweighs episodes.</strong> Delhi’s yearly (seasonal_aqi_waves)
  and monthly (winter_delhi) trends show that high AQI is the norm in winter, not the
  exception. Short-lived events like Diwali add a spike on an already elevated baseline.</li>
  <li><strong>Dispersion matters as much as emissions.</strong> Geography and meteorology
  — flat terrain, weak winter winds, temperature inversions — keep pollutants trapped.
  The COVID lockdown experiment (pre-, during-, and change maps) proved that when emissions
  drop, air improves sharply; when activity resumed, pollution returned. So both emissions
  and the capacity of the atmosphere to disperse them determine outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Diwali is a stress test, not the sole cause.</strong> Year-wise, before/after,
  and period visualisations show that Diwali coincides with an already stressed system.
  The same emissions would have a smaller effect in monsoon; in late autumn they tip the
  system into severe episodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring gaps hide part of the picture.</strong> State-level and
  station-level maps reveal large areas with little or no PM2.5 data. Grey on the map
  means missing monitoring, not necessarily clean air — a limitation for both research
  and policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:16px;">Limitations</h3>
<p>
The analysis relies on publicly available CPCB and OpenAQ data. Coverage is incomplete:
many states and smaller cities have few or no monitoring stations, and temporal coverage
varies. Delhi NCR is well observed (hourly, multi-station); other regions are not. We do
not establish causality — only associations and consistency with a system view of pollution.
Meteorological and emissions inventories were not modelled here; they would strengthen
future work.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:16px;">Recommendations</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:26px;">
  <li>Expand monitoring in data-sparse states and tier‑2 cities so that national and
  city-level assessments are representative.</li>
  <li>Design policy for both emissions and dispersion: reduce sources (vehicles, industry,
  waste burning) and factor in geography and season (e.g. stricter curbs when dispersion
  is weak).</li>
  <li>Use Delhi’s seasonal and Diwali patterns to anticipate severe episodes and communicate
  risk in advance, rather than treating each spike as a one-off event.</li>
  <li>Replicate similar analyses with longer time series and, where possible, link AQI to
  health or economic outcomes for stronger evidence.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="pull-quote">
Some cities breathe worse air not because they emit more — but because their air has nowhere to go.
</div>

<p>
The central takeaway of this project is that air quality in India is a system outcome:
emissions, geography, climate, and timing interact to produce the patterns we see in the
data. Understanding that system is the first step toward solutions that last.
</p>

<h2>Data &amp; methods</h2>

<p>
This analysis draws on three main datasets, all processed from CPCB-backed and OpenAQ
sources and publicly available AQI records.
</p>

<ul style="margin-bottom: 26px;">
  <li><strong>Delhi NCR AQI (2020–2024):</strong> Hourly readings from multiple monitoring
  stations across Delhi and the National Capital Region. Includes PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂,
  CO, O₃, and derived AQI and category. Used for seasonal patterns, Diwali comparisons,
  and yearly trends.</li>
  <li><strong>City-level COVID AQI change (2015–2020):</strong> Pre-COVID baseline
  (2015–2019 average) and lockdown-period (March–May 2020) average AQI for 23 Indian
  cities. Used for the pre-COVID, lockdown, and change maps.</li>
  <li><strong>India PM2.5 snapshot:</strong> Station-level PM2.5 measurements across
  Indian monitoring locations (state, city, station, coordinates). Used for the
  state coverage map and the PM2.5 snapshot map.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Visualisations include: all-India and state-level PM2.5 maps; major-city AQI comparison;
Delhi seasonal and winter AQI; Diwali-period trends (year-wise, before/after, and period
map); and COVID pre-, during-, and change maps. Where applicable, iframes embed
interactive Plotly charts; the live OpenAQ map link reflects current reporting availability.
